# Starting The Scheduler

Your task schedule is defined in the `app/Console/Kernel.php` file's `schedule` method.

In cron:

`* * * * * php /path-to-your-project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`

# Defining Schedules

Schedule a Closure to be called every day at midnight.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console;

use DB;
use Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Console\Kernel as ConsoleKernel;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
    /**
     * The Artisan commands provided by your application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $commands = [
        //
    ];

    /**
     * Define the application's command schedule.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule  $schedule
     * @return void
     */
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        $schedule->call(function () {
            DB::table('recent_users')->delete();
        })->daily();
    }
}
```

## Scheduling Artisan Commands

```php
// artisan command name
$schedule->command('emails:send --force')->daily();

// artisan command class
$schedule->command(EmailsCommand::class, ['--force'])->daily();
```

## Scheduling Queued Jobs

```php
$schedule->job(new Heartbeat)->everyFiveMinutes();
```

## Scheduling Shell Commands

```php
$schedule->exec('node /home/forge/script.js')->daily();
```

```php
// Run once per week on Monday at 1 PM...
$schedule->call(function () {
    //
})->weekly()->mondays()->at('13:00');

// Run hourly from 8 AM to 5 PM on weekdays...
$schedule->command('foo')
          ->weekdays()
          ->hourly()
          ->timezone('America/Chicago')
          ->between('8:00', '17:00');
```

### Between Time Constraints

The `between` method may be used to limit the execution of a task based on the time of day:

```php
$schedule->command('reminders:send')
                    ->hourly()
                    ->between('7:00', '22:00');
```

Similarly, the `unlessBetween` method can be used to exclude the execution of a task for a period of time:

```php
$schedule->command('reminders:send')
                    ->hourly()
                    ->unlessBetween('23:00', '4:00');
```

### Truth Test Constraints

if the given Closure returns `true`, the task will execute as long as no other constraining conditions prevent the task from running

```php
$schedule->command('emails:send')->daily()->when(function () {
    return true;
});
```

The `skip` method may be seen as the inverse of `when`. If the `skip` method returns `true`, the scheduled task will not be executed:

```php
$schedule->command('emails:send')->daily()->skip(function () {
    return true;
});
```

When using chained `when` methods, the scheduled command will only execute if all when conditions return true.

# Preventing Task Overlaps

By default, scheduled tasks will be run even if the previous instance of the task is still running. To prevent this, you may use the withoutOverlapping method:

```php
$schedule->command('emails:send')->withoutOverlapping();
```

If needed, you may specify how many minutes must pass before the "without overlapping" lock expires. By default, the lock will expire after 24 hours:

```php
$schedule->command('emails:send')->withoutOverlapping(10);
```

# Maintenance Mode

Laravel's scheduled tasks will not run when Laravel is in maintenance mode.
To force a task to run even in maintenance mode.

```php
$schedule->command('emails:send')->evenInMaintenanceMode();
```

# Task Output

send the output to a file for later inspection

```php
$schedule->command('emails:send')
         ->daily()
         ->sendOutputTo($filePath);
```

to append the output to a given file

```php
$schedule->command('emails:send')
         ->daily()
         ->appendOutputTo($filePath);
```

```php
$schedule->command('foo')
         ->daily()
         ->sendOutputTo($filePath)
         ->emailOutputTo('foo@example.com');
```

**The `emailOutputTo`, `sendOutputTo` and `appendOutputTo` methods are exclusive to the  `command` method and are not supported for `call`.**

# Task Hooks

Using the `before` and `after` methods, you may specify code to be executed before and after the scheduled task is complete:

```php
$schedule->command('emails:send')
         ->daily()
         ->before(function () {
             // Task is about to start...
         })
         ->after(function () {
             // Task is complete...
         });
```

## Pinging URLs

Using the `pingBefore` and `thenPing` methods, the scheduler can automatically ping a given URL before or after a task is complete. This method is useful for notifying an external service, such as Laravel Envoyer, that your scheduled task is commencing or has finished execution:

```php
$schedule->command('emails:send')
         ->daily()
         ->pingBefore($url)
         ->thenPing($url);
```

Using either the `pingBefore($url)` or `thenPing($url)` feature requires the Guzzle HTTP library. You can add Guzzle to your project using the Composer package manager:

`composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle`
